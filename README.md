This is a mock of the Shopify API

There is a lot of room for improvement:

- The ability to make a shopping cart.
- The ability to filter products by price, collection, using the search params (API)[https://shopify.dev/docs/api/usage/search-syntax]
- Being able to use the Collections as a prior filter.
